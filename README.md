<h1>Usage</h1>

Probably the most useful files from this repository are 
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>faceRecognitionWithProbabilies.py</b> - which recognizes faces from the file specified on 20th line (by default images/mishabidz.jpg),
    using generated datasets from "dataset/encodings.npy" and "dataset/names.npy"
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>datasetGenerateFromDirectory.py</b> - which generates datasets necessary for face recognition to work by
    extracting face encodings and names (which by default are set to file names of images). By default the path of images from where to extract
    images and generate datasets is set to "images/onlyFace/" (set in line 18 and line 19)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>datasetAppendFromDirectory.py</b> - appends face encodings and names to the dataset generated by the file mentioned above. 
    Default folder to generate encodings and file names from is "faceToAppend" (set in line 20 and 21)
  </li>
</ul>
